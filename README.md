# weather-app
My First API projectðŸ˜‡
### [Weather App link to live site ðŸ‘ˆ](https://heisdera.github.io/weather-app/)
### [Vercel link](https://weather-app-brown-tau-47.vercel.app/)

I was about learning useEffect() in React then decided to build this project since i haven't built any API project and also practice some vanilla javascript
